## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [RainInterpreterTs](./classes/raininterpreterts.md) | - The typescript (javascript) version of the RainInterpreter.sol, which basically does the same job offchain, i.e evaluates an expression off-chain with either reading necessary data with onchain calls or by some provided mock data. There are many usecases, simulating and forecasting are just a few to mention. |
|  [Simulation](./classes/simulation.md) | All the things needed in order to conduct a simulation/forecast of Rain Interpreter. this uses RainInterpreterTs under the hood to eval expressions with provided opcode closures and data. Data is either mocked or fetched from on-chain as there are 3 types of simulation defined: always, once, never. These determine how the data will be handled and provided for default simulation which uses Rainterpreter opcodes and their default overrides. For a custom simulation that uses custom interpreter and opcode closures, the opcode closures need to be provided by the user. |

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [callOperand(inputSize, outputSize, sourceIndex)](./variables/calloperand_1.md) | Builds the operand for RainInterpreter's `CALL` opcode by packing 3 numbers into a single byte. |
