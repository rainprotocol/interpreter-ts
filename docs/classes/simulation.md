# Class Simulation

All the things needed in order to conduct a simulation/forecast of Rain Interpreter. this uses RainInterpreterTs under the hood to eval expressions with provided opcode closures and data. Data is either mocked or fetched from on-chain as there are 3 types of simulation defined: always, once, never. These determine how the data will be handled and provided for default simulation which uses Rainterpreter opcodes and their default overrides. For a custom simulation that uses custom interpreter and opcode closures, the opcode closures need to be provided by the user.

```typescript
